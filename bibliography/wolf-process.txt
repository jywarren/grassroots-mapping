The basic workflow I decided on was:

1. Scan through images and remove blurry or over exposed images.
2. Clip outer 10% "frame" of each image (lens distortion is greatest out there
3. Load each image, separately, into ArcGIS and geo-reference to 1ft imagery
  a. ArcGIS geo-referencing uses a surface interpolation to rectify the image
  b. Three points are required as a minimum
  c. More points allow for higher degree polynomials for the surface

I don't like to throw out any imagery until the very end. Sometimes, even the blurry stuff ends up being useful. I never worked it out, but I think I needed about 100 images per acre to get good coverage. Even then, the lighting differences across the images made it seem inconsistent.

I tried using an autostitcher and manually stitching outside ArcGIS but the results weren't as good as treating each image individually. I realized that you could/should make a "flight plan" directing where to walk with the balloon and how long to wait in each spot to guarantee coverage.
