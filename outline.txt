Introduction

    Grassroots Mapping is a... toolkit and a community. 
        - A series of 

    Defining Grassroots Mapping: toolkit, techniques, community?
        - software
            - interface, cartagen framework, rendering architecture
        - the website
        - maps produced
        - the community
    Novelty
        Novel application of low-cost tools to well-established need for raster imagery
        Novel approaches to map rendering
    Strength of project: toolkit & community
Subjectivity in mapping (Beautiful Maps article)
    - often imagine 'complete maps'
        - OSM reference to a 'complete map of UK'
        - Chris Anderson's Wired article of complete dataset
        - Endless variety of possible data: Wood, Power of Maps, p.1
        - not a representation of truth, but a rhetorical tool; Wood, p1?
            - social construction of maps
    - varying definitions of ownership, contested terrain
        - 'Ground Truth' policy in OSM (http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Disputes#On_the_Ground_Rule)
    - ref. West Bank mapping in Dec 2009
        - mapping as testimony of use/presence/ownership by Abed's farm
The need for geospatial information
    Tenure
        - El Otro Sendero
            - graph of informal settlement percentages
        - COFOPRI
    Environmental assessment
        - carbon cowboys
    Data politics/Open geodata
        - UN-SPIDER/Google MapMaker response to Mikel Maron, Chile Earthquake
    UN-HABITAT quotation
State of the art
    PGIS
        Jen Osha's article
        Guide to Participatory GIS
        Claudia Canepa's PhD dissertation
    Peter Poole - Life after Tenure Mapping
        - outsourcing of GIS processing typical, problems
    OSM/HOT
        Map Kibera, Free Map Palestine, Free Map India
        Data modeling: http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Humanitarian_OSM_Tags/Humanitarian_Data_Model
    Shortcomings
        Slum mapping, disaster-specific issues
        architectural/infrastructural shortcomings
Proposed alternative techniques 
    Meet subjectivity needs
        - against a canonical datastore
        - solution lays in tools and formats and practices, not in a single project/datastore
            - therefore GM & Cartagen are based around:
                - a body of code
                - a thorough documentation and guide to mapping techniques
        - options to organize project: as a 'generic hub' for imagery, like OpenAerialMap, engage primarily via internet/blogs
            - or, focus on collaborating with specific communities in cartographic dispute
                - expand into matchmaking between mappers and communities in need, as well as supporting via mailing list 
                - maintain open communication with end-users, iterate back into tools: 
                    - requests made via list: stewart long asks for masking, Crispen asks for entry of lat/lon pairs, WhereCamp folks asked for locking, Pat Coyle asked for 'natural_size' feature
    Meet technical limitations
        - existing solutions based around cloud systems
            - this move opposite - closer to client
            - needs: data under no connectivity
            - multiple devices
            - ownership of data/infrastructure
                - FrontlineSMS, 'local' is a feature, opposite of corporate/commercial strategy
        - low-AI approach; technical literacy, flexibility, admits 'misuse'
            - examples: USGS overlay at WhereCamp 2010
            - additon of non-map features with Warper tool
            - difficulty of use of hugin, etc
                - DIYDrones thread: "3 days stitching and tweaking images" (http://diydrones.com/profiles/blog/show?id=705844:BlogPost:134855&page=1#comments)
            - Stewart Long uses Photoshop for most stitches (get him on record)
Emphasis on building in response to end-user needs
    - this work could only be done by working with communities in cartographic dispute. See Lima case study.

            - Sr. Ricardo - possible political engagement/entanglement
            - entry into SETAME site; playfulness seen as neutrality? Or just no resistance at low levels to mapping activity?
                - not perceived as claim-related?
    Map Warper design issues
        - designed for printed maps
        - large loop of interaction - overcorrection easy, no immediate feedback upon assigning GCPs

Conclusions
    - Many practitioners in this space,  PGIS, OSM, etc.
    - each lacks certain things
        - example: OSM's failure to connect with Rede Jovem; mapping nerds, format-obsessed
            - need to reconcile standards-based, central approaches with community-based, people-centric orgs
        - attempt to fill some gaps, present a coherent and well-documented/tested toolchain and supporting materials
    - bring in not just tech enthusiasts, but broader audience, from children/youth to activists, create dialogue
    - emphasis on working tools, built through iteration and collaboration, rigor, both process and results
        - long-term engagement, if possible.

Linda Raftree: "But when I’m sitting around with a group of people in a rural community without many services, it can be pretty hard to remember or to explain the benefits of digital mapping over low tech map making. Why should people make a digital map if they only have sporadic electricity and internet access (if at all) and not many smart phones.  How will they access that digital map on a regular basis once they make it?  Does the fact that they could make a digital map, necessarily mean that they should?"
