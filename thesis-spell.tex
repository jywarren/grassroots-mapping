\section{Overview}
\section{Defining Grassroots Mapping: Toolkit, Practices, or Community?}

Exactly what makes up the Grassroots Mapping project? Is it a body of code, available under an MIT license at \url{http://github.com/jywarren/cartagen}? Is it a set of mapping practices, or tools, which have been employed in Lima, Peru, or Rio de Janiero? Or is it a community of practitioners and the web site, wiki, and mailing list which tie them together?

The core of the Grassroots Mapping project is the \textbf{application} of a novel combination of technology to a specific cultural need. Without

\chapter{Subjectivity in Mapping}

% text here, why is this chapter necessary:

The need for a more participatory cartography is predicated on the exclusion of many from the practice of map-making as it stands today. Even more importantly, it depends on the point of view that mapping is an inherently non-neutral practice, and that for maps to serve wider and more democratic interests, it must accommodate diverse viewpoints. Maps serve interests, and understanding their role not as documentation of what makes up the world, but as rhetorical, tactical, and \emph{subjective} tools is an important prerequisite to what this document argues.

\section{Neogeographers, Psychogeographers, and GIS}

A brief description of three distinct groups of practitioners is worthwhile, as each embodies a distinct conception of mapmaking. 

\subsection{Psychogeography}

\subsection{GIS practitioners}

Professional map makers have used Geographic Information Systems, or GIS since its development in the 

\subsection{Neogeography}

With the rise of web-based data and display systems came a group composed primarily of programmers and web designers, who have adopted the name \emph{neogeographers}. This group positions itself in contrast to 'traditional' approaches such as GIS, and

\section{The mythical 'complete' map}

The most famous (yet fictional) version of this fantasy is Jorge Luis Borges' short story 

'a mile to the mile!'
'So we now use the country itself, as its own map, and I assure you it does nearly as well.' p.169

This idea was later elaborated in Jorge Luis Borges' 

% Of Exactitude in Science

% ...In that Empire, the craft of Cartography attained such Perfection that the Map of a Single province covered the space of an entire City, and the Map of the Empire itself an entire Province. In the course of Time, these Extensive maps were found somehow wanting, and so the College of Cartographers evolved a Map of the Empire that was of the same Scale as the Empire and that coincided with it point for point. Less attentive to the Study of Cartography, succeeding Generations came to judge a map of such Magnitude cumbersome, and, not without Irreverence, they abandoned it to the Rigours of sun and Rain. In the western Deserts, tattered Fragments of the Map are still to be found, Sheltering an occasional Beast or beggar; in the whole Nation, no other relic is left of the Discipline of Geography.

% The piece was written by Jorge Luis Borges and Adolfo Bioy Casares. English translation quoted from J. L. Borges, A Universal History of Infamy, Penguin Books, London, 1975.

The idea that maps accurately, or even completely depict a location is not entertained in a literal sense, yet amongst

\chapter{Case Study: Grassroots Mapping in Lima, Peru}

\section{Introduction}

In the interest of basing tool development and design on real-world applications, and due to an ongoing conversation with Carla del Carpio of Lima-based Manzanita "A", 

traveled to Lima, Peru in January 2010 to conduct field research and to collaborate on the Grassroots Mapping tool set with those who would be likely to use it.

\subsection{Designing with, not for}

Needs assessment

%                    - very specific information about construction/infrastructure from Frank & others
%                    - maquette in 3D - unsolicited - wealth of specific information about goals
%                        - 3 story buildings (sendero - stored wealth/bank accounts)
%                        - explicit connection between mapping and urban planning
%                        - real engaging activity as a corollary to mapmaking
%                        - references to infant care (WaWaWasi), shops, flowers, soccer fields

\subsubsection{Stitching maps with Juan Pablo II}
                - Stitching exercises
                    - with kids - 'rubber sheets'
                        - with teachers (secondary audience) - Map Warper, discussion of difficulties (see ahead)

\subsection{Mapping with San Ignacio Loyola}
% (have title and survey)
            - Manzanita "A"
            - usage of Photoshop primarily; fast mapping; 2-3 hrs flight, 1-2 hrs stitching
            - Hector: ideal user: 
                - lives in an informal settlement
                - teacher, interested in using this in curriculum
                - community leader
                - interest in tech, willing to try map warping
                    - difficulty in trackpad/menu usage, took notes
                - engaged despite workload
                - sees applicability for mapping tools in settlements

\subsection{Mapping with Cantagallo}
            - Escuelab - technology, art, society
            - engaged with a creative group, Shuawa
\subsubsection{The Shipibo in Lima}
            - narrative of 10 year stay, claim to land, contested claims, and riverbank site
            - Escuelab sought political neutrality, but obviously interested in political situations: ex: shipibo language            - Drawing exercises
                - 'amazon' home vs current home
                - non-literal mapping - related to issues of veracity re: Wherecamp sugg. of children mapping with stickers
\subsubsection{Flying balloons with Cantagallo}
- fastest yet
                - total images
                - usage of hugin/SIFT/Photoshop
\subsubsection{Lower Cantagallo and local geographic dispute}
            - Escuelab and Sara/CEDRO
	- two cantagallos (three?)
            - Sr. Ricardo - possible political engagement/entanglement
            - entry into SETAME site; playfulness seen as neutrality? Or just no resistance at low levels to mapping activity?
                - not perceived as claim-related?
\subsection{Computing literacy challenges with orthorectification}
	- map warper
        - designed for printed maps
        - large loop of interaction - overcorrection easy, no immediate feedback upon assigning GCPs
        - difficulty in explaining GCPs, and necessity of javascript hack for areas without base data
        - amazing for intended use, even note application in Mumbai
    - Photoshop better, but barely
	- stuart long uses photoshop, maybe bruce owen (see emails)
\subsection{Evaluation}
- based on criteria
        - Interviews!!!!!!! transcribe them
        - Applications of maps we made
            - legal role
            - import to OSM?
            - World Bank mandate to map every home? do we support that goal?
            - education, urban planning, NGO planning support, demonstration project
\subsection{Needs (Re)assessment}
- Goals for a true 'pilot' that goes beyond information gathering and use of existing State of the art tools
   - planning of new, easier interfaces and techniques
                - Map Warper difficulties, speed
            - discussion and 'designing with' leading to Cartagen Knitter (see later discussion)
            - needs assessment - user-centric design, appropriate design
    - Possibility of mapping a fast-changing community
        History/future assignments make explicit the value of mapping as an activity

It comprises contributions from two political geographers, a military geographer, a political scientist, and two activist cartographers and argues that there is not so much a need to “rethink” maps, but to “re-engage” with the material practices of mapping, and above all to “re-make” maps.

Lots of work by Proboscis: \href{http://urbantapestries.net/}{Social Tapestries/Urban Tapestries}, 2002-7 - Urban Tapestries investigated how, by combining mobile and internet technologies with geographic information systems, people could `{}author'{} the environment around them; a kind of Mass Observation for the 21st Century. Like the founders of Mass Observation in the 1930s, we were interested creating opportunities for an ``{}anthropology of ourselves''{} – adopting and adapting new and emerging technologies for creating and sharing everyday knowledge and experience; building up organic, collective memories that trace and embellish different kinds of relationships across places, time and communities.
