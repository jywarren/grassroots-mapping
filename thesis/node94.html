Spatial resolution</A>
</H2>

<P>
Resolution can be measured in the spatial, temoral, and spectral axes; spatial refers to distance in x,y,z in the physical world, temporal refers to the frequency of image capture, and spectral resolution is the amount of color information preserved in an image. Spatial resolution in aerial imagery is referred to in terms of meters or centimeters per pixel; that is, how many meters or centimeters in the real world correspond to the width or height of a single (presumably square) pixel in the photographic data. For example, typical resolution in Google Maps for urban areas in the United States is approximately 1-2 meters. 

<P>
On a purely technical basis, there were several key benefits to to the techniques employed by the Grassroots Mapping project. In terms of spatial resolution, the typical balloon or kite map ranges from 2-150 cm in resolution, depending on the camera used, the camera altitude, and the desired output resolution. This bridges an important gap in publicly accessible aerial imagery, as commercial satellites today are limited by US law to 50 cm resolution, and the GeoEye 1 satellite, which offers the best current resolution, offers only 141 cm color imagery. This is especially important in environmental applications; Vierling et al emphasize in their use of balloon imagery that `...there still exists a gap between canopy scale processes and landscape level satellite remote sensing measurement.' [<A
 HREF="node120.html#vierling2006short">56</A>] The resolution required to identify objects on the ground is typically three to five times smaller than the target objects, so to identify an object 10 cm wide, a resolution of 2-3 cm is required. [<A
 HREF="node120.html#aber2002unmanned">1</A>] This is a reasonable target resolution for balloon and kite imagery.

<P>
This is accentuated by the lack of control over the time imagery is captured. Purchasing existing satellite imagery is expensive, at about US$ 15 per square kilometer (cite Mikel or his sources) but to buy new imagery requires waiting for a satellite to pass over the target area, or even for operators to actually repoint the satellite in space, and thus is even more costly. In the citizen mapping of the BP oil spill in 2010, daily imagery of the spill was available only from the NASA satellites Terra and Aqua, whose MODIS imaging sensor captured a resolution of only 1 km -- though each image could capture the entire oil spill. The images were further obscured by cloud cover (a common challenge with satellite imagery [<A
 HREF="node120.html#miyamoto2004use">38</A>]) and glare from the sun, although I emphasize that the MODIS imagery is extremely useful for different reasons than those captured by balloon or kite; volunteers at the Louisiana Bucket Brigade often used MODIS imagery to identify likely sites to perform kite and balloon mapping. In fact, the two resolutions are almost impossible to reconcile, as all of the citizen maps produced by the Bucket Brigade fit within one or two pixels of the MODIS data. (see illustration)

<P>
The capture resolution is, of course, a compromise between the desired surface area of coverage and the desired resolution. For example, if a balloon is flown at 1200 meters above the ground, a typical 5 megapixel point and shoot camera will capture an area approximately 1000 meters square <B>per photograph</B> at a resolution of approximately 40 cm. To double that resolution would require flying the balloon at an altitude of approximately 800 meters. In either case, a viable way to increase coverage is to move around with the tether on the ground, either by walking or in a boat or other vehicle. This has the disadvantage of taking a lot of time -- in the above example of flying at 1200 meters, to double the resolution would require walking roughly a kilometer in any direction. This is further complicated by obstacles such as closely spaced trees, power lines, etc.

<P>
Human scale -- This considerably better resolution than is typically available makes it possible to produce maps that relate to the human scale;
