Funding model</A>

<P>
Mapping the spill incurred a range of new costs; not only is there a virtually unlimited potential area to map, but the intention to repeatedly map each site meant that there is no completion criterion for the effort -- trips are led and imagery is captured as often as possible given the constraints of time and money. Travel turned out to be the most expensive part of the project. Not counting the hours of donated time and associated fuel costs on boats, planes, and in cars, a typical day in a chartered boat cost approximately $US 400, and even teams visiting only the shoreline had to travel for upwards of 3 hours each way from LABB headquarters in New Orleans. 

<P>
Various donors and institutions were generous in their support of the project, including the Center for Future Civic Media, the Lafourche Port Commission, the Washington Post, Development Seed, and many more.<A NAME="tex2html94"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot915"><SUP>8.2</SUP></A> In order to meet these expenses, on May XX I created a proposal at http://kickstarter.comKickstarter.com with help from filmmaker Kristian Hansen. Kickstarter is a site where individuals can elect to `back' a project financially, receiving rewards for different levels of support. For $100, we offered to put backers' names on a balloon, for $500, we promised to send backers a complete Grassroots Mapping Kit. However, the vast majority of donations were at the $25 level, for a total of XXX contributors by June X

<P>
(Work on numbers above)

<P>
Funding the project in this manner rather than via larger institutional grants seemed appropriate for an already citizen-led, independent effort to document the oil spill's effects. For many, contributing a small amount or even simply spreading the word was the only means of participating. For these reasons the choice of Kickstarter as a means to financial sustainability is especially relevant to the project's mission. 

<P>
