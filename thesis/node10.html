GIS practitioners
</H1>

<P>
Professional map makers have used Geographic Information Systems, or GIS since the 1960s, which in recent decades has increasingly centered on the ArcGIS suite by ESRI. More recently, GIS as a methodology has met with some criticism amongst newer generations of digital map-makers for its widespread use of expensive proprietary tools such as ArcGIS, both for their cost and because such tools present a high barrier to non-expert participation due to their complex interfaces. However, it is easy to forget that GIS were created as part of a movement towards a more participatory and interactive cartography, by reducing the costs and increasing the abilities of users to manipulate and publish geographic data.

<P>
Another, parallel movement known as `critical GIS' but encompassing several groups such as Qualitative GIS, Feminist GIS, Participatory GIS and Public Participation GIS evolved starting in the 1990s with roots in human geography as well as amongst GIS practitioners themselves. These critical GIS proponents have challenged traditional GIS practice from a humanist perspective, for its failure to incorporate non-quantitative sources, and for its `potential for exclusion and disempowerment' [<A
 HREF="node120.html#elwood2009qualitative">18</A>]. Other proponents of a Qualitative GIS such as Marianna Pavlovskaya have assaulted the quantitative basis for GIS, pointing out amongst other reasons that much of GIS usage relies on spatial imagination and intuition, as in many visual examination-based techniques. She notes that most GIS software ships with only basic spatial analysis capabilities, and suggests that the high reliance on human reasoning in typical usage has been obscured by `unfriendly user interfaces'. Most importantly, Pavlovskaya draws attention to the fact that the most common output of GIS use is in visualizations, designed for `visual impact', and as such emphasize heuristic interpretation over quantitative. [<A
 HREF="node120.html#pavlovskaya2009nonquantitative">44</A>] 

<P>
Instead, critical GIS proponents argue that GIS is primarily a power relation, due to its association with authoritative quantitative analysis and the `fascination of Western science and geography with vision, seeing, and looking as a primary and supposedly objective way of knowing, which is in fact partial, embodied, and masculinist.' [<A
 HREF="node120.html#pavlovskaya2009nonquantitative">44</A>]<A NAME="tex2html17"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot884"><SUP>2.1</SUP></A> The resulting image of `GIS as a powerful juncture of science, technology, and authority' [<A
 HREF="node120.html#pavlovskaya2009nonquantitative">44</A>] leads to an exclusivity that places the benefits of geospatial information and technology beyond the reach of the public and in the hands of those already in power. Pavlovskaya and her colleagues advocate a broader and more inclusive practice of cartography which incorporates anthropological and `mixed methods' methodologies -- including photographs, community-produced paper maps, and `3D model mapping' where participants construct multimedia scale models of their communities in a discursive and process-focused activity. 

<P>
These attempts to reconceptualize GIS practice have matched well with the work of participatory or public participation GIS (PGIS) researchers who have -- often in developing countries, or with indiginous groups -- sought to develop more inclusive map-making activities to address these criticisms of conventional GIS. These have included ground mapping, performed in an outdoor area using stones or flags to create scaled maps, and relief model mapping using three dimensional cardboard contour maps annotated with pins and labels.<A NAME="tex2html18"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot885"><SUP>2.2</SUP></A> As Robert Chambers remarks, PGIS techniques have met with widespread adoption and success across the world, due to their `power and versatility... the relative ease with which it can be facilitated, the fun, fulfilment and pride which people derive from it, and its multiple uses by so many stakeholders'. [<A
 HREF="node120.html#chambers2006whose">11</A>]

<P>
Despite sharing many of the same goals of inclusive, participatory techniques, an emphasis on making the audience into producers of information, and inexpensive tools designed for non-experts, neither the critical GIS movement nor the experimental geography movement widely collaborated with or even communicated with the following group, which from a technological perspective has perhaps the greatest potential to innovate new tools and techniques.
