Challenges of conventional PGIS practice
</H2>

<P>
Critics of PGIS practice point out that despite the emphasis on inclusion in the map-making process, final map processing is often outsourced

<P>
More to the point, there persists a detached anthropologic attitude wherein PGIS researchers are `capturing' data; there is a definite note of surprise that `indigenous' communities, whether in sub-Saharan Africa or simply in communities without a high degree of technical fluency, could author good maps. The excitement over the moment of cartographic understanding which the following quotation depicts is tempered by the condescension it suggests: 

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
It was also in 1988 in an AKRSP (India) RRA training... that a headman, asked to present to the villagers the map the outsiders had draw, had difficulty until he turned it ``upside down", which was the way he and the villagers saw their village . . . . We were teetering on the brink of learning that ``They can do it".

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
PGIS researchers have not been insensitive to these issues; Robert Chambers...  `Many ethical issues present troubling dilemmas, and lead to overarching questions about empowerment and ownership. Questions to be asked, again and again, are: Who is empowered and who disempowered? And, who gains and who loses?' [<A
 HREF="node120.html#chambers2006whose">11</A>]

<P>
In practice, there is a question of formats: while for many communities a paper map would be the ideal end product, many cartographers feeel the need to produce digital maps in a variety of formats, such as shapefile, KML, WMS, etc. This raises the question of who the intended audience is -- the funding agency, perhaps, or the PGIS academic community, or even the blogosphere. These are valid considerations; if the map-making is intended to help a community to communicate with official entities, i.e. to affect a cartographic power relation, a digital end product may help to `translate' local knowledge into the relevant language of power. 

<P>
As a result, many PGIS map projects outsource the final processing of map data to GIS experts. While in many cases this may seem like the only way to produce a completed map without the time and expenditure of training local participants in the use of GIS software, perhaps starting with basic computing skills, it may also be a means to build a better and more integrated relationship between the local community and those governmental entities they are attempting to communicate with. However, this is speculative and Peter Poole writes that such an advantage `has yet to be widely demonstrated', citing examples in Suriname and Venezuela. He further points out that outsourcing ties local communities to the expert GIS entity in the event that they wish to repeat or extend their mapping efforts. [<A

Beyond these pragmatic difficulties presented by outsourcing,
