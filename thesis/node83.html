Licensing and data use</A>

<P>
The assembly of a public domain archive of data, including GeoTIFFs, TMS and raw images, is a valuable goal in itself. Due to increased mapping activity after the Katrina disaster, much imagery of the coast already existed, however not at such good resolution. Our inclusion of pre-spill imagery will, as participant Adam Griffith put it, `remind us what the land should look like'. [] The post-spill maps will help to identify and assess the environmental and economic damage which coastal ecologies and communities have sustained.  

<P>
The project is ongoing, and even after our current funding and timeline end in January, there is potential to perform ongoing mapping at longer intervals. While the immediate needs of providing imagery to the public and the media have been met, our longer term goals of using the data for litigation and environmental monitoring will require collaboration with those communities, and plans are already in motion to present the data at relevant venues. 

<P>
Our choice of a blanket public domain policy has meant that with the exception of some donated imagery, all our data has been released into the public domain and may be downloaded and republished without permission. We expect this to facilitate its adoption by researchers, litigators, and other activists, just as it has amongst the media. Already, images have been republished by the Boston Globe, the New York Times, and many other news agencies. Much of the data has even be licensed to Google for use in the Google Earth and Google Maps products. This reversal -- small organizations providing imagery to Google instead of the opposite -- stands in contrast to the licensing bottleneck which caused so much trouble in the Haiti aid community, as discussed in Section <A HREF="node27.html#subsec:satelliterelease">4.3.1</A>. 

<P>
As more such projects unfold<A NAME="tex2html98"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot918"><SUP>8.3</SUP></A>, I hope that the successes we have had in the Gulf Coast will not only provide a wealth of relevant information for other would-be mappers, but that our work will inspire others to adopt these practices in new and interesting ways.
