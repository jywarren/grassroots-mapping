Catalytic Validity</A>
</H3>

<P>
One of the most important outcomes of the Grassroots Mapping project is how it has changed participants' assumptions of what kind of information they are able to collect. This is a key aspect of what Lather refers to as <B>catalytic validity</B>, `the degree to which the research process re-orients, focusses, and energizes participants'. In the case of the 2010 BP oil spill, most organizations I spoke with initially did not understand what I meant by mapping -- their response to the spill simply did not take into account the possibility that new aerial data could be captured without a satellite or an aircraft. 

<P>
This moment of inspiration can be frustratingly ..... In Lima, Peru, mapmaking is performed by civil engineering firms using traditional surveying techniques. At one point, we were engaged in a mapping exercise with youth from the Canta Gallo community, when leaders of the group came in to the same room to have a meeting with one such firm over the progress of their map! Despite having shown previous maps I had made with other communities, none of the leaders seemed to be interested in applying the techniques towards their apparently immediate needs.  

<P>
Most of the groups I have worked with experience a moment of excited inspiration upon seeing the first images of their own site, fresh off of a balloon flight. 

<P>
rock creek doubts, later buy-in "We should order a bunch of weather balloons right now!"
