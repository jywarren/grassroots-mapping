GonzoEarth and manual stitching with Adobe Photoshop
</H2>

<P>
One of the main practitioners of low-cost mapmaking today is Stewart Long and his one-man company GonzoEarth, which provides `applied neogeographical techniques for on-demand mapping' [<A
 HREF="node120.html#long2010process">28</A>]. Long is responsible for such impressive maps as the 2009 map of Burning Man, published at a 2 cm/pixel resolution<A NAME="tex2html55"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot899"><SUP>5.1</SUP></A>. This map was surprisingly warped onto a lower resolution base map, blended, and output as a BigTiff image using Adobe Photoshop CS4. The image was then reprojected and saved as a GeoTIFF using the open source GDAL package. Long's use of Photoshop extends to all his mapping work, due to its ability to `make dynamic selections, transformations, and stitching' including layer merging and flattening. [<A
 HREF="node120.html#long2010process">28</A>] While observing his process, I noted that he would repeatedly return to earlier images in order to adjust them iteratively, treating the map imagery almost like paint rather than data. GonzoEarth maps are among the best available in that they are seamless and consistent, and Long has a unique intuitive grasp of the process, as well as a great deal of patience. Careful observations of his work have played a major role in the design of the Cartagen Knitter, described in Section <A HREF="node51.html#subsubsec:knitter">6.2.1</A>. 

<P>
The imagery for the Burning Man map was taken from a helium balloon by Jack Alderson, but Long also captures imagery by using a lightweight and relatively inexpensive remote control airplane called the Easystar, sold by the German company Multiplex. A small canon camera is inserted into the cockpit and a hole is cut in the belly of the plane through which the pictures are taken. Long can fly the plane at up to a half-mile away, steering manually with a 2.4 Ghz transmitter and can capture imagery at hundreds of feet in the air. The plane can remain in the air for up to an hour.
