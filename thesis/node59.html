Mapping with Juan Pablo II</A>
</H2>

<P>
Both Manzanita `A' and CEDRO were enthusiastic about the potential of a mapping project from the outset, and Carla del Carpio coordinated with CEDRO's Ernesto Fernandez to set up a 6-day program, or `Projecto Integral' with a group of approximately a dozen students in the Juan Pablo II settlement in Lima's Villa el Salvador district at the south end of the city. Each day of activities, held between January 12 through 28th, lasted from 11am until approximately 3pm. 4-6 CEDRO instructors and 2 from Manzanita `A' attended, and the twelve of so students ranged from 8 through 14 years old. The Juan Pablo II community consists of approximately 6 blocks of homes arranged in a loose grid, though this was not apparent from the Google Maps imagery, which we dated to approximately 2006, or 4 years earlier. The community was 5-6 years old, and many but not all of the students remembered when their families had first come to the site. 

<P>
We began the workshop with an introduction to map making, by asking students to work together to draw their community. This resulted in a variety of means of representation, though through prompting, they tended increasingly toward birds-eye view. Even then, some experienced difficulty with collaborating at a common scale, with some adjustments and redrawings occurring once each student's map intersected their neighbor's. Next, students enthusiastically constructed measuring tapes and we broke into groups to literally measure the homes. 

<P>
An attempt to show the existing Google Maps imagery and to ask students to identify their homes or even the entire community in a map were not successful; the maps did not seem relevant to participants, as most students seemed not to have a high degree of computer literacy or exposure to the internet.
