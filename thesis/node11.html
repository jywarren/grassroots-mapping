Neogeography
</H1>

<P>
With the rise of web-based data and display systems came a group composed primarily of entrepreneurs, programmers and web designers, who have adopted the name <I>neogeographers</I>. This group positions itself in contrast to traditional approaches such as GIS, and favors open data sharing, standards-based data formats. Neogeographers advocate a kind of `people's GIS', and has have worked to develop a set of free and open source software tools to replace proprietary solutions. The neogeographic movement, though it might have found its roots in the opening of the Google Maps API (see Section <A HREF="node31.html#sec:webmapping">5.1</A>), focuses today on largely web-based software such as OpenLayers, Mapnik, and GeoDjango. Some downloadable map viewing and editing packages such as QGIS or JOSM are also available, though even these are often used to produce data for web publication. The availability of a relatively complete open-source toolchain for authoring and publishing maps is a result of the gradual shift away from easy-to-use commercial APIs. [<A
 HREF="node120.html#rana2009neogeography">50</A>] However, some services such as Google's geocoding API, Yahoo's Placemaker API, and a variety of commercial satellite imagery sources, are still relied upon -- generally because they outperform open-source alternatives. In some cases, equivalent open alternatives are nonexistent or not widely known.

<P>
One identifying theme in the neogeography movement is the shift of users from consumers to producers of maps, though primarily in the online world. [<A
 HREF="node120.html#oconnor2008maps">40</A>] The ability to create and publish map data using simple and free tools has dramatically broadened participation in map making, and Rana and Joliveau suggest that neogeography rejects the `prescribed role/interaction between the four main components, namely the audience, the information, the presenter and the subject...'. [<A
 HREF="node120.html#rana2009neogeography">50</A>] Neogeographers prefer `crowdsourced' data, contributed by collaboration and volunteerism, to proprietary data, which they have come to distrust due to copyright, access, and format limitations. Data produced by the public and liberally licensed for public use, may be translated, republished, remixed, and repurposed without parasitic reliance upon large and often uninterested organizations and governments. 

<P>
Another important aspect of the movement is that the creators of neogeographic software tools typically do not have a formal or academic background in geography or GIS, but from a programming and software engineering background. This has some technical benefits, in that the solutions they promote and develop are often conceived of from a novel perspective, sometimes resulting in higher performance, broader applications, and reconcetualizations of both what and <B>for whom</B> maps are for. It has also resulted in an `outsider' attitude amongst neogeographers, and even some resentment from traditional GIS practitioners; this has played an important role in how the movement presents itself to the rest of the world, and what choices it makes in the development of tools. For example, the OpenStreetMap project, discussed at length in Section <A HREF="node33.html#sec:openstreetmap">5.2</A>, was developed in response to the restrictive crown copyright of the British Ordnance Survey national map. [<A
 HREF="node120.html#chilton-crowdsourcing">13</A>], and was eventually 

<P>
While neogeography shares many of the goals of the PGIS movement, relatively little communication exists between these two factions due to their different origins and mutually isolated venues for publication.<A NAME="tex2html19"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot97"><SUP>2.3</SUP></A> Rana et all describe neogeography as an `outcome of the increasingly close integration of our lives with geocomputational and World Wide Web technology.' That statement may be more accurate if `our lives' refers to the lives of neogeographers, or at most refers to that thin slice of the global population which knows what an API is, or owns an iPhone. As discussed in Chapter <A HREF="node20.html#chap:need">4</A>, most of the world has little or no access to digital geospatial services and information, and this may account for the mounting interest in such tools' application in areas of crisis or humanitarian need. In the last few years, we see an increasing number of neogeographers engaging in socially or politically engaged work -- groups such as the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team, Washington-based firm DevelopmentSeed, NiJeL, Ushahidi, and many more. Many of these have formed partnerships with larger and older organizations such as the World Bank and even the United Nations. A more in-depth examination of such works and the relevant technologies was published in 2008 by Sean O'Connor and the Tactical Technology Collective under the name `Maps for Advocacy'. [<A
