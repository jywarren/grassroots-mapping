Privacy and mapping, privacy and open geodata</A>
</H2>

<P>
Privacy is of course yet another reason to shy away from total mapping. Indeed, for any publicly available map to include such details as the positioning of my coffee table or wifi router <A NAME="tex2html26"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot888"><SUP>3.3</SUP></A> offers a more clear view into my personal space than I care to allow. The further Google Street View and similar services invade that space, the more many people feel uncomfortable with such cartographic enthusiasm. Appropriating these technologies in support of bottom-up efforts can invert these issues, and the ability to make maps for oneself as analytic tools, or to publish selective geographic information to a specific audience, can recast such technologies as empowering and enriching.  

<P>
This is one of the most difficult aspects of participatory map-making, in that I am often asked questions such as, `Why would a community allow you to come take aerial pictures of their homes?' This is a fair question, but one which thoroughly misunderstands what I am advocating. My work is intended to teach and assist communities and individuals in mapping themselves, to build literacy and proficiency in geographic tools and information, and to make good choices about how to publish their maps -- if at all. The maps which I have published here are only those for which I have requested specific permission to reproduce for purposes of education and research. The decision of a community to publish their work is one which I am very cautious to encourage, as another question I am asked is, `Isn't mapping just a means for the state to exert influence and control over geography?'
