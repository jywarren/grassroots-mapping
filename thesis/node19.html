Cartographic ethics
</H1>

<P>
In light of this reassessment of the political and social roles of maps and their production, some from the PGIS community have called for a code of ethics in participatory mapping projects. This seems especially prudent given that the production of maps can have dramatic effects on the residents of the mapped area. Giacomo Rambaldi, Robert Chambers, Mike McCall, and Jefferson Fox proposed in 2006 a set of 33 guidelines entitled `Practical ethics for PGIS practitioners, facilitators, technology intermediaries and researchers'. The following is a sampling:

<P>
<UL>
<LI>Do your best to recognise that you are working with socially differentiated communities and that your presence will not be politically neutral
</LI>
<LI>Consider using spatial information technologies that can be mastered by local people (or local technology intermediaries) after being provided sufficient training
</LI>
<LI>Be considerate in taking peoples' time
</LI>
<LI>Stimulate spatial learning and information generation rather than mere data extraction for outsiderâ€™s analysis and interpretation
</LI>
<LI>Ensure that the outputs of the mapping process are understood by all those concerned
</LI>
</UL><BLOCKQUOTE>

 HREF="node120.html#rambaldi2006practical">48</A>]

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
These guidelines demonstrate an belief that maps should be produced <B>in collaboration with</B> local communities, and with respect for their needs and interests. Even in the context of an openly activist agenda, they have proved invaluable to the author in formalizing and understanding his interactions with mapping participants. In particular, they address the core concern of who owns the maps and for whom they are made; there is often the implicit assumption by enthusiasts of open geodata that simply dumping map data into OpenStreetMap is the end goal. It is important to be aware that most people (and especially those in communities in geographic conflict) are unaware of the existence of OpenStreetMap, and would likely be unreceptive to its benefits. 

<P>
Robert Chambers in particular warns PGIS practitioners against raising expectations of concrete results, noting that `Any process of analysis facilitated by an outsider is liable to raise expectations of some benefit, even when the outsider goes to pains to explain that they have nothing to offer and nothing will follow from their visit. Disappointment, and reinforced disillusion with visitors and organisations outside the community then follow.' [<A
