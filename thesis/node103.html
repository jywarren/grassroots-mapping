Illustrated Guides
</H1>

<P>
Originally suggested on the Grassroots Mapping mailing list in ....... by list member Pat Coyle, the idea of an illustrated guide to provide a rich and cross-language instruction set has received some attention. Storyboarding, outlining, and initial sketches were begun in the spring of 2010 by Pay Coyle, Nathan Cooke of MIT's D-Lab, 

<P>
Crispen Wilson or Peter Poole asked for a guide.... find the email

<P>
The 4-page PDF guide developed for the Louisiana Bucket Brigade was a quick attempt to provide such instructions, but was primarily intended to serve as an organizational guide and checklist, with tips and reminders, rather than a complete start-to-finish guide. 

<P>
For those interested in learning or teaching Grassroots Mapping techniques, there is also a five page illustrated guide in English, Spanish, Portuguese and Georgian.
