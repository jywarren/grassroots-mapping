Ushahidi</A>
</H3>

<P>
The Ushahidi platform has emerged as a common and easy-to-install system for crowdsourced crisis reporting. Developed in collaboration with Kenyan programmers to help voters report election violence in Kenya in 200x, it allows citizens with mobile phones to send 140 character text messages to a publicized telephone number. [<A
 HREF="node120.html#okolloh2009ushahidi">41</A>] These messages are read by a group of editors, who attempt to identify where the messages were sent from, and are published on a web site as red dots at their assumed location. That users self-report their locations, and can do so incorrectly, is tolerated because it may represent a means of privacy for some users, and because in the aggregate it is quite difficult to `fake' an event. (cite Meier's post) Each report is verified if possible by ..., however in many cases no verification is possible, yet in emergency response situations this has proven not to impede the use of Ushahidi data by agencies such as (in the Haitian earthquake of January 2010) the Coast Guard, the US Marine Corps, and FEMA. [<A
 HREF="node120.html#meier2010crowdsorcerors">34</A>][<A
 HREF="node120.html#meier2010ushahidi">36</A>] 

<P>
Ushahidi works in many cases because it is simple to understand on its surface: visitors to an Ushahidi web site see a series of dots with messages such as `I'm stuck under rubble' and imagine a person sending such a message from their cell phone. It makes use of existing communications infrastructure, namely that most people have cell phones and relies on both a high level of literacy with text messaging and a willingness to send reports to a site which is not immediately viewable. However, it is not a means to `make' a map per se, but rather to collect data on events occurring at specific times, and correlating them with an existing map.

<P>
Ushahidi has been successfully used to gather and publish extremely up-to-date information about unfolding crises, for example in the instance created by the New Orleans-based environmental group LABB in response to the BP oil spill in April 2010. The kind of information it provides, however, is difficult to verify or to quantify, and is more useful in the context of emergency response than in evidence-gathering. [<A
 HREF="node120.html#meier2010verification">37</A>] Locations must often be approximated to the nearest town or city, and most reports are often just a few words with no name or photographic evidence. While geotagged photographs can be uploaded to Ushahidi, EXIF data can be falsified. In many cases there is an additional need for quantitative data. Map imagery provides more comprehensive information in that every pixel of a map has a corresponding location in the real world, allowing it to be correlated against other maps. 

<P>
However, a combined strategy involving the use of an Ushahidi-like platform with aerial imaging can result in clusters of crowdsourced reports providing target sites for followup map-making sessions. This process was employed in the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico between the LABB Ushahidi instance and LABB-led Grassroots Mapping trips.<A NAME="tex2html50"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot897"><SUP>4.2</SUP></A> Maps of oil-affected areas were then posted back to the Ushahidi site as TMS layers.
